# Tic Tac Toe

## Tic Tac Toe program

Create a matrix to store the tic-tac-toe board. Write a program that allows you to interact with 2 players, reading their moves and displaying only the final situation on the board on the screen. The match will be held between the 2 players, and the program will only have the functions of:

- Read each player's move. Example: Play in position 1 1 (Line 1, Column 1);
- Check if the move is valid: we cannot play in a position where a piece has already been placed or they are off the board, if the move is invalid it is necessary to print `"Error\n"`;
- Check if the game is over, that is, if there is a winner (someone completed a row, column or diagonal) or if the entire board was filled and there were no winners (Tie). If there is a winner, it is necessary to print which player was the winner, on the bottom line, where the sequence of symbols that led to the victory is (Ex: "Line 0", "Column 2") and finally, the board situation .
