# Gratification

---

## Gratification program

A company decided to give a Christmas bonus to its employees, based on the number of overtime hours and the number of hours the employee was absent from work. The prize amount is obtained by querying the following table. Show the final gratuity.

```bash
H = ( number of overtime hours ) - ( 3/4 * (number of absent hours) )
```

| H                 | Gratificaiton   |
| -------------     |:-------------:  |
| Until 600         | `$100,00`       |
| 601 to 1200       | `$200,00`       |
| 1201 to 1800      | `$300,00`       |
| 1801 to 2400      | `$400,00`       |
| Above 2400        | `$500,00`       |

 H = overtime - ((3 * absent)/4);
 
 if (H <= 600)
  printf("\nGratification: $100.00\n");
