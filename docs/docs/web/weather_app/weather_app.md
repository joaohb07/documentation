## Technologies

To fetch location and weather data, I used APIs that do this job.

### APIs

#### Geocode API

To use geolocation info, such as, latitude and longitude from a specified location I used [***OpenCage Data API***](https://opencagedata.com/api#quickstart).

#### Weather API

To use real time info about weather, I used [***OpenWeather Map API***](https://openweathermap.org/current).

### Libs

I used the following npm libs to develop this app:

1. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - For creating a web server.
2. [Hbs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs) - Handlebars for custom dinamic HTML views.
3. [Postman Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-request) - To make a request to the APIs.
