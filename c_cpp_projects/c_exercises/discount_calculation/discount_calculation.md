# Discount Calculation

---

## Discount Calculation program

Make a program that receives:

- Purchased product code;
- Quantity purchased of a product;
- Following the table, calculate and display in order:
  - Unit price of the product purchased following table above;
  - Total price of the note;
  - Discount amount, following the table 2 and applying it to the total price of the note
  - final price of the bill after the discount
  - **Table One**:
  
    | Code          | Price |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | 1 to 10       | $ 10,00    |
    | 11 to 20      | $ 15,00    |
    | 21 to 30      | $ 20,00    |
    | 31 to 40      | $ 30,00    |

  - **Table Two**:

    | Note total price     | Discount (%) |
    | -------------              |:-------------:|
    | Until `$ 249,99`                  | 5%     |
    | Between `$ 250,00` and `$ 499,99` | 10%    |
    | Above `$ 500,00`                  | 15%    |

## Execute

Clone `main` branch from [**c-cpp-projects**](https://github.com/joaohb07/c-cpp-projects).

Access this folder on terminal:

```bash
  cd c-cpp-projects/c_exercises/discount_calculation
```

### Run with GCC compiler

With [**GCC**](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) compiler installed run the following commands:

1. Compile the `cpp` file:

    ```bash
    gcc discount_calculation.cpp -o execute -lm
    ```

2. Run the `execute` compiled file:

    ```bash
    ./execute
    ```

### Run with Docker

With [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) installed run the following commands:

1. Build the container and images:

    ```bash
    docker build -t gcc-docker .
    ```

2. Run the container with the built image `gcc-docker:latest`:

    ```bash
    docker run -it gcc-docker:latest
    ```
